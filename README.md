# vBase
> Vandijkstef's Web base

This repository contains CSS and JS I use on many websites. It is recommended to include this repository as gitmodule, but feel free to download/fork this and use as you like. The aim is to provide a solid starting point for every web-project, without including needless bloat. While this is absolute true for CSS, JS consists of usefull classes that can be required, thus compiled and delivered to the user on a per-need basis.

## (S)CSS
The SASS included provides a main starting point. There is no additional documentation right now

## JS
All javascript should comply with ES6 standards, and build in (modular) classes. It's recommended to compile this into ES5 on production envoirments.

## Building
The NPM scripts to get your SCSS and JS compiled are included. (TODO:)

## Contributing
For this project contributions are accepted under the following order of conditions:
- The contribution is discussed in an issue (on Github)
- The commit/pull request references this issue

Obviously, discussion is open on the issues boards even when you don't intend to commit.
Note that this project is not trying to recreate a reset.css, jQuery or Bootstrap, but rather a solid and slim base for next-gen webdevelopment. 

## TODO
- Find a way to have generic data-like classes (address, user, product, cart, etc) easily integratable into various systems
